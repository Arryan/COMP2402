# Review - Array

- Sequential storage data structure

```java
Integer[] n = { 1, 3, 7};
```

- `n` is a reference variable contained in the heap
- Each index of array contains an address that points to an `Integer` object
- Access any element in **constant** time

# Observations about Array

- Access time
  - O(1)
- Insert time
  - At back: O(1)
  - At front: O(n)
- Remove time
  - At back: O(1)
  - At front: O(n)
  - At _i_: O(n - i + 1)

# Review - Singly Linked List

- The last node (the tail) is indicated by having a reference to `null` instead of another node
- Sequential access data structure

# Observations about Linked List

- Access time
  - O(_i_ + 1)
- Insert time
  - O(_i_ + 1)
- Remove time
  - O(_i_ + 1)

# HW

- Read chapter 1.1, 1.2
